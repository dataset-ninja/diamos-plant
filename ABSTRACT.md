Classification and recognition of foliar diseases is an increasingly evolving field. research that uses machine learning and deep learning concepts to support agriculture parties concerned.
DiaMOS Plant is a pilot dataset contains images of an entire growing season of pear tree, from February to July, in order to build a representative sample which, cover the main cultural aspects of this plant. The dataset is suitable to perform machine and deep learning methods in classification and detection tasks. A total of 3505 images were collected, including 499 fruit images and 3006 leaves images, respectively. The fruit is portrayed in the following 4 phases: fruit set, nut fruit, fruit growth, ripening. Similarly, biotic and abiotic stresses fall into 4 categories: leaf spot, leaf curl, slug damage, and healthy leaf.
