**A Dataset for Diagnosis and Monitoring Plant Disease** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 3505 images with 3753 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *slug leaf*, *spot leaf*, *pear*, and other: *curl leaf* and *healthy leaf*.

Images in the DiaMOS Plant dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 13 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, the images have ***severity level*** tag. The severity level is determined based on the percentage of leaf area affected. The dataset was released in 2021 by the University of Cagliari, Italy.
